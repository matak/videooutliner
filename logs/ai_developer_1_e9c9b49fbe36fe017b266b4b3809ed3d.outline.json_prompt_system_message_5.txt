Analyze this portion of a lecture transcript and create a structured outline in JSON format. Return only the json format, nothing else. The json should contain only english language.
Rules:
• Each level (main topics and any nested subsections) may contain **no more than 10 items**.
• If more than 10 items belong at one level, create additional nested levels so every level stays ≤ 10 items.
• For every node include:
  - "title": brief heading  
  - "start_time": "HH:MM:SS" of first mention
  - "subsections": [] (array holding any children; empty if none)
• This is chunk 5 from total 14 of the transcript.

Return ONLY valid JSON with this exact overall shape:

[
    {
        "title": "Main Topic",
        "start_time": "HH:MM:SS",
        "subsections": [
            {
                "title": "Subtopic",
                "start_time": "HH:MM:SS",
                "subsections": []
            }
        ]
    }
]
